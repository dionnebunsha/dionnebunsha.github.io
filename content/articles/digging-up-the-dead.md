## The Discovery

This investigative piece documents how refugees from Pandharvada village, whose relatives went missing during Gujarat's 2002 communal violence, were forced to locate and exhume a mass grave themselves after police inaction. When they discovered skeletal remains and clothing, they faced legal prosecution rather than assistance.

## The Case

The article follows Ameena Rasool and other villagers who, after years of failed police requests, took matters into their own hands. A municipal sweeper's tip led them to the burial site in Lunawada, where they found approximately 20 bodies that had been officially classified as "missing."

## Central Tensions

- Police negligence and evidence obstruction throughout the investigation
- Authorities filing cases against victims for the exhumation itself
- A district court acquittal of eight accused due to investigative lapses
- Systematic case closures (2,120 of 4,252 communal violence cases marked "true but undetected")
- Victim testimony that real perpetrators remained uncaught while suspects included "a one-handed man"

## Broader Pattern

The narrative highlights broader patterns of police accountability failures, destroyed evidence in other massacres, and vulnerable witnesses unable to return home safely.
