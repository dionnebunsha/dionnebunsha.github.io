Vidarbh experiences three farmer suicides daily. The crisis stems from a combination of factors: cotton prices have collapsed while input costs soar, international imports flood the market, and the government provides minimal protection or subsidies compared to other nations.

## The Human Cost

Chandrakant Gurnule, a 35-year-old cotton farmer, exemplified this tragedy. Facing Rs 1.05 lakh in bank loans plus moneylender debt, he spent Rs 60,000-70,000 on farming but recovered only Rs 40,000 from his cotton crop. In April 2006, he immolated himself, leaving his family devastated.

## The Economic Reality

Since 2001, Vidarbh has recorded 2,279 suicides. The minimum support price of Rs 1,750 per quintal covers only one-fourth of cultivation costs. Meanwhile, pesticide prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 240 per bottle, and urea rose from Rs 80 to Rs 280 per bag within a decade.

## Global Market Pressures

Between 1997-2003, India imported 110 lakh cotton bales—exceeding total post-Independence imports. International cotton prices crashed from $1.10 per pound (1994) to 38 cents (1998). The government maintains only a 10% import tariff, whereas the US protects farmers through $4 billion in annual subsidies and 90% tariffs in countries like China.

## Failed Solutions

The Prime Minister's Rs 3,750-crore relief package proved insufficient. Interest waivers and fresh loans offered temporary reprieve but didn't address structural problems. Additionally, 314 of 450 cotton-farming suicides involved Bt seeds, which failed to reduce pest problems while increasing expenses.

## Structural Obstacles

Only 10% of Vidarbh has irrigation, limiting crop diversification. Soil depletion requires escalating fertilizer and pesticide applications annually. Extension services remain absent; farmers rely on pesticide dealers and advertisements instead.

## The Disparity

One meter of cloth sells for Rs 50 minimum; the cotton lint required costs only Rs 6. India's textile industry profits while 30 lakh cotton cultivators struggle. As activist Vijay Jawandhia states: "Farmers are living only because they are not dying."

The article concludes that globalization benefits India's elite while marginalizing agricultural workers earning Rs 25 daily—a system characterized as "slavery for the export market."
