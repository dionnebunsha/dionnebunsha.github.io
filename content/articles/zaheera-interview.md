## Introduction

Zahira Sheikh is the most visible and controversial riot victim from Gujarat following communal violence. She has changed her testimony three times throughout legal proceedings. Initially, she provided detailed accounts to police and the National Human Rights Commission about a massacre at her house. However, she became hostile during the Vadodara Sessions court proceedings, leading to convictions. She subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial outside Gujarat, claiming she lied due to threats from local BJP MLA Madhu Shrivastav.

## On Her Decision to Recant

Zahira explains she faced an impossible choice: "On the other side, there were threats to kill me...I was in a dilemma. Whether to save the lives of my family or to make sure that those who killed and burned our family were punished."

## Sources of Intimidation

Threats began four or five days before her court appearance through neighborhood intermediaries and local political figures. A Congress councillor allegedly told her: "Decide now. Do you want to save your family's lives or do you want these people to be punished?"

## Courtroom Experience

She describes the courtroom atmosphere as dangerous, with accused perpetrators present, which heightened her fear and influenced her testimony.

## Current Status

She relocated to Mumbai to escape threats and states: "I want the case to be re-opened but I don't want to fight it in Gujarat."
