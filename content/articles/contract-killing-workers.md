## The Tragedy

Aktar Khan had endured seven years without employment following his job loss at Tata Power Company. Unable to secure stable work, he subsisted on odd jobs like construction and painting—insufficient to support his wife and five daughters. Facing imminent homelessness, he joined colleagues protesting outside Bombay House, Tata's headquarters, demanding rehiring.

When management relocated their meeting without notice, Aktar and colleague Anant Dalvi reached their breaking point. Both self-immolated outside the company office. Anant died immediately; Aktar followed days later in hospital. His wife Amina expressed devastation: "I have left my daughters with my mother. They have exams."

Workers criticized the response: "They shut the doors of Bombay House...Neither the Tata management nor the union came to visit the workers in the hospital." The company countered that they offered hospital transportation and financial assistance, claiming police prevented their involvement.

Tata maintained these workers weren't their responsibility, noting their services "came to an end" after project completion seven years prior, though most had worked 15-20 years on various projects before permanent termination in 1996.

## The Broader Crisis

Mumbai's economy has fundamentally transformed. Once attracting migrants with promises of dignified work, the city now offers precarious employment. Manufactured goods production has relocated, replaced by banking, finance, and hospitality sectors hiring fewer laborers.

Employment composition inverted dramatically: early 1960s saw 65% of jobs in organized manufacturing with benefits; today approximately 65% occupy unorganized sectors lacking wage regulations, hour protections, or security. Skilled factory workers now hawker goods, paint, courier, drive taxis, or guard properties.

## Collapse of Manufacturing

Textile mill employment collapsed from 250,000 workers in 1981 to roughly 30,000 currently. These factories shuttered without compensating workers. High real estate values incentivized owners to sell land rather than operate factories, replacing mills with shopping centers and corporate offices.

Worker Suryakant Mahadik earned Rs 6,000 monthly at Khatau mill seven years prior; as a taxi driver he now earns Rs 3,000. His children perform garment piecework for education expenses. "Our phone was cut off...We haven't celebrated Divali. I can't buy new clothes for the children."

Another former coworker, Chandrakant Gavde, committed suicide by train four years prior after losing his security guard position following two absences for his wife's cancer treatment.

## The "Flexible" Economy

This represents the new flexible economy—workers abandoned without social safety nets. Contract work and outsourcing dominate while traditional unions struggle organizing unorganized sector workers. Economist Neeraj Hathekar observed: "Workers are being retrenched without any social security to fall back on. People have become desperate enough to kill themselves."

Land scarcity marginalizes poor populations further. Self-employed hawkers face displacement by citizen groups. Working-class chawls in central Mumbai yield to skyscrapers, pushing workers toward city peripheries.

Marginalization has intensified suicides among desperate workers. The economy's flexibility has proven deadly—some workers have literally "keeled over."
