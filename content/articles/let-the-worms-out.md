## The Discovery

The Supreme Court directive mandated a review of over 2,000 "true but undetected" cases in Gujarat, exposing systemic police failures in investigating communal violence crimes.

## A Case Study

The piece examines the case of Bilkis Yakub Rasul, the sole survivor of a massacre where fourteen family members were murdered during the 2002 Gujarat communal violence. Despite naming her attackers, police dismissed the case as lacking evidence, labeling her "unstable."

## Key Systemic Problems

- Police labeled cases as "true but undetected" to close investigations without pursuing justice
- The CBI later discovered six policemen and two doctors deliberately destroyed evidence
- Approximately 2,000 cases—roughly half of 4,252 filed during 2002 violence—were improperly closed
- Accused individuals listed as "absconding" were "roaming free" while witnesses remained unprotected
- Multiple FIRs identifying politicians as mob leaders mysteriously vanished from police records
- A witness in the Naroda Gaam case was imprisoned for four months after implicating political figures
- Naroda Patiya massacre (over 100 dead) saw 38 witnesses' cases closed and consolidated rather than individually pursued

## Similar Patterns

The article notes a similar pattern in Mumbai's 1992-93 communal violence, where 60 percent of riot cases were unlawfully closed, with minimal reopening success under subsequent investigation efforts.
