Journalist Dionne Bunsha provides an investigative account of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) training camp in Patan, northern Gujarat. The piece documents rifle shooting instruction, physical combat training, and ideological sessions delivered to young recruits.

## Camp Overview

The article chronicles Bunsha's visit to a VHP camp where participants receive instruction in weapons handling, martial arts, and Hindu nationalist ideology. Camp organizers initially resist photography and scrutinize the journalist's credentials. VHP leader Surendra Jain from Delhi delivers speeches contrasting Hinduism favorably against Christianity and Islam, arguing that Hindu tolerance has been misinterpreted as weakness.

## Key Participants and Ideology

Camp participants represent diverse backgrounds—engineering students, farmers, and laborers—who cite communal incidents or family tradition as reasons for joining. One trainee states: "All Hindus should sign up to protect our religion against Muslims."

VHP instructor Ashok Vaghela notes the organization's dual-track approach: "The Bajrang Dal teaches more about security work compared to the RSS. But both have the same goals—to create a Hindu Rashtra."

## Note

This article appears in Bunsha's book "Scarred: Experiments with Violence in Gujarat," endorsed by author Arundhati Roy.
