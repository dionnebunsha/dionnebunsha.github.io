## The Issue

The article documents how Greenpeace activists protested the Agriculture Minister's consideration of large-scale Bt brinjal field trials—the first GM food crop trials at this scale in India. The approval process raises alarm among scientists and environmental groups over insufficient safety testing and potential health and environmental risks.

## The Core Problem

The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) is reviewing clearance for Bt brinjal despite documented problems with Bt cotton. In 2006, approximately 1,600 cattle and sheep died in Andhra Pradesh after consuming Bt cotton stalks and leaves.

## Scientific Concerns

Dr. Pushpa Bhargava, a renowned geneticist, criticized the testing: "It is an absolute scandal for us to allow further trials despite the failure of Bt cotton" and warned that "these committees don't even have specialised scientists."

## Health Risks Identified

- Farm workers exposed to Bt cotton reported allergies and skin eruptions
- The Cry1Ac gene may trigger adverse immune system reactions
- Potential interference with intestinal bacteria if consumed by humans
- Concerns about antibiotic resistance markers in GM seeds

## Environmental Impact

- Risk of genetic contamination of traditional crop varieties through pollination
- Effects on soil microorganisms and butterfly/moth populations
- Documented decline in soil productivity among Bt cotton farmers

## Industry Perspective

Mahyco (the seed producer) asserts the toxin only affects insects, citing studies showing mammals can safely consume up to 100mg per kilogram of body weight without adverse effects.

## Alternative Evidence

Field studies by the Deccan Development Society found organic farming methods produced higher net returns with lower pest management costs compared to Bt cotton, contradicting industry claims about productivity benefits.
