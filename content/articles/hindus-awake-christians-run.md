## The Campaign's Scope

The VHP, led locally by Swami Aseemanand, has orchestrated a systematic effort framed around a religious festival. Organizers planned to attract over 500,000 pilgrims to a district with just 200,000 residents—nearly all Adivasi. The slogan "Hindu awake, Christian run" openly declares the initiative's communal intentions.

## Infrastructure & Development

Authorities invested 3-4 crore rupees in roads, water systems, and facilities. A small pond was renamed "Pampa Sarovar," supposedly where Lord Ram met his follower Shabari. However, the author notes no historical evidence supports this claim or the religious precedent for holding a Kumbh Mela at this location.

## Land Dispossession

Multiple Adivasi farmers reported losing property to the Shabari trust. Manad Powar claimed security guards threatened him when he approached his own 3.5-hectare plot after temple construction began. Government officials allegedly assisted the land appropriations.

## Intimidation Tactics

Sangh activists distributed free goods to mobilize support, photographed Christian homes and institutions, and made direct threats. One woman recounted activists entering her residence, destroying a Jesus image, and warning: "If you don't follow Ram, you will be finished in the Kumbh Mela."

## Community Context

Unlike forced conversions, Adivasis reportedly embraced Christianity for healthcare access and spiritual comfort, not coercion. Their indigenous religious practices centered on nature worship—distinct from Brahmanical Hinduism the Sangh promotes.

## Legal Response

Human rights organizations filed Supreme Court cases requesting minority protections against the hate propaganda being disseminated.
