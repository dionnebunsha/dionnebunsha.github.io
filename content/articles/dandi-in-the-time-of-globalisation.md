## The Contemporary March

Bunsha documents the 75th anniversary march retracing Mahatma Gandhi's historic 1930 Salt March from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, Gujarat. The contemporary yatra attracted approximately 500 participants—a diverse assembly of Indian youth volunteers, international visitors from the US, China, and Australia, Pakistani activists, and devoted Gandhi followers.

The author contrasts the original march's austere defiance against British imperialism with the 2005 iteration's modern infrastructure: "There were trucks, motorbikes, VIP cars, police vans, rickshaws, camel carts, even a convertible and a trail of plastic cups."

## Key Participants and Voices

**Rajkumar Jeswani**, a spare parts salesman from Ahmedabad, served as the march's self-appointed masseur, stating: "I am a poor man, but I wanted to do something for Bapu. This is my Shraddhanjali (offering) for him."

**Turab Ali Bohra**, a 75-year-old retired plumber from Madhya Pradesh, reflected: "In my old age, there's no better joy than being part of Gandhiji's march."

**Shahid Alam** of the Pakhtoon Students Federation represented 92 Pakistani marchers, emphasizing: "Common people on both sides want peace. It's only the politicians and fundamentalists that keep us apart."

**Mike Wadleigh**, the acclaimed American documentary filmmaker, criticized Western consumption patterns and globalization's negative influence on India.

## Historical Context

The original Salt Satyagraha (March 12 – April 6, 1930) mobilized massive civil disobedience against British salt monopolies. Gandhi's symbolic act of harvesting salt inspired nationwide resistance, with 227 village officials resigning their positions.

## Political Dimensions

Congress Party sponsorship enabled the yatra's logistics but generated debate regarding authenticity. Tushar Gandhi, the event organizer and Gandhi's great-grandson, defended the affiliation, emphasizing that the march's commemorative purpose transcended partisan considerations.
