---

This investigative piece examines the displacement of Sahariya Adivasi communities from the Kuno-Palpur forest sanctuary in northwestern Madhya Pradesh. Approximately 1,545 families from 24 villages were relocated to make room for an Asiatic lion translocation project from Gujarat's Gir forest. The article documents the severe hardships faced by relocated villagers, contrasting their struggles against promised rehabilitation benefits that largely failed to materialize.

## The Displacement

Despite promises of improved living conditions, the resettled Adivasis received barren, rocky land unsuitable for agriculture. Villagers who previously cultivated two crops annually in the forest now struggle as daily laborers breaking rocks for minimal wages.

## Living Conditions

The new villages lack adequate water, grazing land, and fertile soil. As one resident noted, "the land is too shallow to hold any water." Malnutrition among children and disease increased after relocation.

## Economic Impact

Agricultural failures created mounting debts reaching 30,000-40,000 rupees at 60% interest rates. Some communities returned to the forest illegally during monsoon season to cultivate crops successfully.

## The Promise vs. Reality

Though the rehabilitation package appeared comprehensive on paper—electricity, schools, irrigation, medical facilities—implementation remained incomplete. Some families received inferior land through lottery systems favoring more powerful community members.

## Wildlife Conservation Rationale

Experts argued that establishing a satellite Asiatic lion population at Kuno protected against potential epidemics wiping out the species, concentrated exclusively in Gir forest. However, Gujarat's government ultimately refused transferring lions to the sanctuary.
