Twenty years after hosting one of Canada's largest civil rights protests against old growth logging, Clayoquot Sound faces a critical moment. The 1993 summer demonstrations drew over 12,000 participants and resulted in more than 800 arrests, yet the ancient forests remain unlogged but legally unprotected.

Located on Vancouver Island's west coast, Clayoquot Sound retains "some of the last remaining rare intact watersheds and old growth temperate rainforests" in the region. The protests sparked significant forestry reforms, introducing ecosystem-based management approaches that prioritize ecological preservation alongside sustainable human use. These changes led to approximately 61 percent of Clayoquot's forested lands being designated as parks or reserves.

## The Landmark Shift

A landmark shift occurred when the major forestry operator sold its Tree Farm Licenses to five local First Nations—Tla-o-qui-aht, Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Yuutuʔitʔath, and Toquaht—who established Iisaak Forest Resources Ltd. in 1999. "Iisaak" translates to "respect" in the Nuu-chah-nulth language. The company committed to avoiding intact watershed logging and pursuing Forest Stewardship Council certification, with environmental groups pledging support in exchange.

However, Iisaak struggles balancing ecological stewardship with financial obligations. The company carries substantial debt from acquiring the licenses and has faced pressure to generate returns. A 2011 proposal to log Flores Island—an intact watershed—prompted fierce opposition from environmentalists and some community members, forcing abandonment of those plans.

## Conservation Initiatives

Currently, an alliance including Friends of Clayoquot Sound, ForestEthics Solutions, and Greenpeace negotiates "conservation finance" agreements with First Nations leadership. These initiatives aim to raise funds for debt repayment while establishing permanent watershed protection. Resource worker Saya Masso advocates for reformed forestry tenure law, proposing "conservation tenure" options that would reduce logging pressure and enable alternative revenue sources like carbon credits.

The article concludes by questioning whether First Nations and the B.C. government can ultimately protect Clayoquot's remaining intact forests.
