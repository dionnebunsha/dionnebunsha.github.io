## The Confidential Report

When three Indian Government ministers visited resettlement sites in Madhya Pradesh, they discovered severe failures in rehabilitation efforts. Their confidential report, later published in The Hindu, exposed systematic problems.

## Key Findings

- Officials offered barren land or inadequate cash compensation
- Only 2 families accepted land offers while 405 refused
- The government deducted 90,000 rupees as income tax from every 100,000 rupees compensation
- Bribes of 20,000 rupees were reportedly required for compensation checks
- Dharmapur, promoted as a success story, had no infrastructure and no occupied plots

## Scale of Displacement

The project will displace approximately 700,000 people. Currently, 51,445 families from 245 villages face submersion, with 27,934 families already affected. An additional 13,233 families await resettlement.

## Opposition and Consequences

Activists including Medha Patkar conducted a 20-day hunger strike protesting the dam's height increase. They were arrested for attempted suicide. Chief Minister Narendra Modi countered with his own brief fast, claiming the dam's water benefits drought-prone regions—though evidence suggests most water benefits wealthy areas while drought-stricken regions receive minimal allocation.

## Environmental Impact

The project will submerge 47,000 hectares of forest and 12,000 hectares of fertile plains.
