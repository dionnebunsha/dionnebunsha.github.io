## Opening Scene

Outside Jarsol village, celebrations unfold while residents remain fearful indoors. Jiva Powar, an Adivasi Christian, watches pilgrims from his home surrounded by paramilitary troops, deeply uneasy about the festival's implications.

## Threats and Displacement

Sangh activists warned Christians that the Kumbh would involve forced purification rituals and conversion to Hinduism. Many families fled villages preemptively. The Shabari Kumbh Trust forcibly seized Jiva's land on the Pampa Sarovar, constructing stalls and shelters without permission. He fears the government will ultimately declare the land trust property.

In Mukkamal village, Manad Powar sold one acre to the trust but they seized his entire 3.5-acre farm to build the Shabari temple.

## Religious and Political Context

The VHP created this fifth Kumbh Mela based on sant Morari Bapu's claims that the location was where the tribal saint Shabari fed Lord Ram berries. Using an Adivasi figure to promote Brahmanical Hinduism makes the concept accessible to tribals whose traditions center on nature worship. One Dang Raja reportedly reconverted from Christianity to Hinduism.

## Anti-Christian Propaganda

The official website contains extensive hostile rhetoric, stating that the Christian Church targets India through conversion and that "Christian activism" made it unsafe for Hindus to venture outdoors after dark.

## Ground Reality

No involuntary conversions occur; instead, Christian Adivasis restrict their movement due to the hostile atmosphere created during the festival. On the final day, reports emerged of a mob destroying tombs in a Christian cemetery in Ghumadia village, though the district collector dismissed these accounts as rumors.

## Administrative Complicity

District officials, including the collector and secretary, held a press conference under the Kumbh's banner, signaling state backing. Development funds designated for tribal areas funded festival infrastructure. Twenty-two check dams and roads were constructed rapidly before the event.

## Environmental and Legal Concerns

Anticipated six lakh pilgrims threatened a district of fewer than two lakh residents. Environmental damage prompted the Central Ministry of Environment and Forest to investigate. Public interest cases were filed in the Supreme Court against illegal activity in a protected forest and the Kumbh's inflammatory video CD.

## Outsider Participation

Most pilgrims came from Surat, Ahmedabad, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra via Sangh-organized buses. A farmer from Ujjain stated they came "for the ride," attributing the event to religious switching making residents "enemies of the nation." Local Adivasis reported no employment opportunities; outside workers filled positions.

## Political Rhetoric

Morari Bapu cited scripture opposing conversions, while Chief Minister Narendra Modi warned that preventing conversions was his constitutional duty. Modi framed the Kumbh as a development path that would eliminate poverty and preserve local culture.

## Long-term Concerns

Locals fear the festival represents the beginning of larger changes. In Saputara, a village converted into a hill station, government forced 40 families to surrender land through imprisonment and coerced document surrender as bail. Those families received 10 acres instead of promised farmland from their original 300-acre village, subsequently working as casual laborers.

The Shabari Kumbh Trust obtained thumbprints from villagers on blank papers—a practice that troubled residents who questioned potential misuse with government connivance.

## Conclusion

Bunsha identifies the Kumbh as the opening phase of the Sangh's broader Dang expansion, warning that intimidation and development projects will likely follow the festival's conclusion.
