## The Plan

This investigative piece examines the Sikkim government's plan to construct approximately 26 hydroelectric dams across the state, with seven projects concentrated in Dzongu—the ancestral homeland of the Lepcha indigenous community.

## Indigenous Rights & Cultural Survival

The Lepchas, Sikkim's earliest inhabitants, comprise less than 7% of the state's population. Dzongu, their protected sacred territory, faces severe threats from dam construction. Young Lepcha activists, including Dawa Lepcha and Onchuk Lepcha, have undertaken extended hunger strikes to oppose the projects. Lepcha protesters argue that the influx of migrant workers accompanying dam construction would demographically overwhelm their 7,000-person community.

## Environmental Concerns

A carrying capacity study warned against large-scale development in geologically sensitive regions, citing risks of glacial lake outburst floods, landslides, and flash floods. The report specifically recommended against projects upstream of Chungthang, yet seven dams are planned north of this location.

## Local Impact

Villages near the Teesta Phase 5 project experienced severe consequences: blasting-induced structural damage to homes, dried water sources, destroyed agricultural productivity, and displacement. Residents reported having received no employment benefits despite losing livelihoods.

## Government Position

Officials dismissed environmental concerns, characterizing the projects as "eco-friendly" and claiming voluntary land acquisition with appropriate compensation.
