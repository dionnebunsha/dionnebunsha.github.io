## Background Events

The violence erupted after a train compartment fire sparked by a confrontation between Hindu activists and a Muslim tea vendor at Godhra station on February 27, 2002. During the subsequent VHP-organized bandh, mobs attacked Muslims across 20 of Gujarat's 26 districts, resulting in over 1,000 deaths and leaving refugees in camps for months.

## Author's Motivation

Bunsha explains she was initially reluctant to return to Gujarat but felt compelled to document the violence after witnessing repeated testimonies of brutality. She sought understanding by interviewing perpetrators, victims, and officials, attempting to contextualize the violence within political and social processes.

## Key Themes Addressed

### Violence Scale and Targeting

The author notes that 713 of 975 deaths were Muslim victims according to government statistics, indicating systematic targeting rather than spontaneous conflict.

### Perpetrator Perspectives

Bunsha describes interviews with figures like Babubhai Bajrangi, who displayed confidence in escaping accountability and pride in their actions, attributing this to perceived political protection.

### Systemic Discrimination

Beyond immediate violence, the book explores ongoing marginalization including ghettoization, school segregation, employment discrimination, and economic boycotts against Muslims.

### Investigation Challenges

Witnesses faced hostile administration, botched police investigations, and social pressure. Many cases were closed as "true but undetected," leaving victims without justice despite extensive evidence.

### The Godhra Question

Bunsha addresses the train fire's origin, noting lack of clear evidence for premeditation while questioning whether violence against innocent people could be justified regardless.

## Notable Quotes

"Nothing happened. Leave Gujarat alone," was the refrain from those downplaying the violence and its ongoing effects.

The author reflects that "Literal thousands waited outside police stations daily saying 'This is what happened to us'" but police remained unresponsive.

## Conclusion

Bunsha's work aims to humanize statistics by providing names and faces to victims while attempting to understand the minds of perpetrators within broader communal and political contexts. The book documents both immediate violence and systemic discrimination persisting long after the riots ended.
