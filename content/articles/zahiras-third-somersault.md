## The Initial Attack

On March 1, 2002, a mob attacked the Best Bakery in Vadodara, owned by the Sheikh family. Armed assailants targeted the building during anti-Muslim violence following the Godhra train incident. The attack killed Zahira's uncle and sister, along with four children from a neighboring home.

## The Testimony Shifts

Initially, Zahira filed a police report identifying mob members from her locality. She remained committed to justice until shortly before trial. However, in May 2003, she and family members recanted at the Vadodara Sessions court, claiming they saw nothing due to darkness. This reversal resulted in acquittal of all 21 accused.

Subsequently, Zahira and her mother emerged from hiding, alleging they had lied under threat from political figures including BJP legislator Madhu Shrivastav. Social activist Teesta Setalvad supported their appeal for justice. The National Commission for Human Rights petitioned the Supreme Court for a retrial, which was unprecedented—the court ordered proceedings in Mumbai rather than Gujarat.

## The Second Recantation

Despite this opportunity, during the retrial at Mazgaon court, the Sheikh family again recanted, claiming insufficient light to identify attackers. Five family members (Zahira, mother Sehrunissa, brothers Nafitullah and Nasibullah, and sister Sahira) turned hostile as witnesses.

## Discrepancies

Discrepancies emerged: While Sheikh family members claimed darkness prevented identification, five other witnesses—including sister-in-law Yasmin and bakery workers—successfully identified numerous accused individuals. Police videotape evidence confirmed the presence of both Yasmin and Zahira's grandmother at the scene, contradicting family denials.

## Questions of Influence

The article raises questions regarding alleged financial incentives. Zahira's legal representation included Atul Mistry (junior to defense counsel Rajendra Trivedi from the original case) and Jal Unwala (connected to K.J. Sethna, whose brother Justice B.J. Sethna upheld the original acquittals).

An Ahmedabad lawyer quoted observes: "witness compromise extends beyond riot cases to most legal matters" due to India's slow, expensive judicial system.

## The Tragic Irony

Bunsha concludes by highlighting the tragic irony: accused perpetrators might be freed while the Sheikh family faces perjury charges, leaving victims of the Best Bakery attack without justice.
