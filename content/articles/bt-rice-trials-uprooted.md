## The Uprooting

Activists from the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association uprooted Bt rice crops from farmer Rangaraju's field in Ramanathapuram near Coimbatore without his full knowledge. The farmer had signed an agreement with Mahyco but hadn't realized he was growing genetically engineered seeds. His daughter expressed dismay: "They did not tell us much. Let's hope it will not put our next crop in danger."

Similar actions occurred in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh when the Bharatiya Kissan Union burned Bt rice harvests to prevent contamination. Farmers and local officials had signed agreements without understanding the implications of genetically modified crops.

## Scope and Concerns

Mahyco is conducting 10 field trials across six states. Rakesh Tikait of the BKU stated the destruction was necessary because "they are toying with farmers' ignorance about GM technology."

## Health and Environmental Risks

- No country has commercially approved Bt rice
- Studies suggest potential allergic reactions in farm workers exposed to Bt cotton
- Possible interference with intestinal bacteria and immune system suppression
- Risk of contamination spreading to native crop varieties through pollination

## Export Implications

Rice exporters joined protests, fearing contamination could harm India's rice trade, particularly in Basmati-growing regions. The article notes contaminated GM rice from China entered European products.

## Regulatory Failures

The Supreme Court temporarily halted new field trial permissions, citing irregularities including incomplete biosafety testing before trials begin, minimal monitoring, and conflicts of interest within regulatory bodies.

## Industry Response

Mahyco's managing director claimed proper protocols were followed, including 20-meter isolation distances. He argued Bt crops increase productivity and reduce pest-related crop losses up to 20 percent.

## Alternative Solutions

Agricultural researchers suggested indigenous plant varieties and traditional breeding techniques offer proven, sustainable alternatives to genetic engineering for improving rice yields.
