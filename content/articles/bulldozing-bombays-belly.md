## The Campaign

The city's bustling street economy, valued at Rs 1,600 crore and employing 200,000 people, faces systematic destruction as deputy municipal commissioner Chandrakant Rokde implements a decades-old court order banning hawkers from main streets.

The 1985 Supreme Court ruling prohibits handcarts, tables, vending after 10 p.m., and street food preparation. This threatens Mumbai's iconic vendors selling pau bhaji, bhel puri, vada pau, and chai—symbols of the city's entrepreneurial spirit.

Within two months, Rokde removed 5,000 vendors, targeting 20,000 hawkers from 60 major roads. He argues congestion near railway stations and bus diversions justify the crackdown. However, this represents merely 10 percent of the city's hawker population.

## Individual Impact

Radhika Dhoiphode, a vegetable seller earning Rs 3,000 monthly, faced two-month work bans. Proposed relocation to a five-story Hawking Plaza required Rs 100,000 per stall—impossible for subsistence earners.

Bhagita Krishna Gaikwad described brutal raids: "We were all rounded up and put in jail for two days." Municipal security confiscated goods without explaining retrieval procedures. Hawkers face Rs 1,200 fines reclaiming merchandise.

Limju paani vendor Rafiq Mohammed Attar questioned the contradiction: "A government that cannot provide jobs has no right to take away our livelihood."

## Legal and Economic Context

The same 1985 judgment acknowledged hawkers' rights serving public interest. A 1989 Supreme Court decision upheld street vending as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g).

Historically, Mumbai licensed 14,000 hawkers in 1950. The 1988 'pauti' system collected Rs 146 crore annually through daily cleaning charges before termination in 1998. Municipal authorities now claim those funds converted to bribes.

The Bombay Hawkers Union estimates 3 lakh street vendors citywide. A 1997 Tata Institute survey documented 1.02 lakh hawkers. Approximately 20 percent were retrenched mill workers forced into the informal sector, comprising 65 percent of Mumbai's workforce.

## Selective Enforcement

Critics note the corporation ignores illegal encroachments by Mumbai's elite—buildings, shops, and restaurants in affluent neighborhoods. Ironically, several demanding hawker removals began as street vendors themselves.

The central government's 2001 directive requested halting vendor removal until finalizing national policy, which the municipality ignored, prioritizing court compliance over alternative solutions.

## Quote

"We are not taking action against the small hawkers. Only those occupying prime spaces and those who have encroached on public space, running businesses with large turnovers will be removed."

— Chandrakant Rokde
