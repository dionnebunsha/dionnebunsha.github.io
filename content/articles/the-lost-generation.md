## The Crisis

Nine out of 100 tribal children die of hunger in Maharashtra. Though Adivasis live in the most resource-rich areas, they are India's most deprived people.

The piece documents severe malnutrition and preventable child deaths among tribal populations in Nandurbar district, Maharashtra. Eight-month-old Gomi's case illustrates the crisis—undernourished and constantly ill, she died five days after the journalist's visit.

## Key Findings

Researcher Dr. Abhay Shukla notes that "every hour in Maharashtra, there is an avoidable death of one tribal infant." A state government survey found three of four infants in tribal Nandurbar were malnourished, with 57% of malnutrition-related deaths going unreported.

The mortality rate for children under five in tribal areas reaches 92.3 per 1,000—significantly higher than Maharashtra's 69.9 average.

## Root Causes

### Health Services

Primary health centers lack equipment, trained staff, and accessibility. Many locations are 11+ kilometers from settlements. Anganwadis (child care centers) fail to distribute food to eligible children consistently.

### Economic Deprivation

Forests have been depleted, leaving tribals unable to cultivate land or gather forest products. Eighty-six percent of surveyed families were food-deficient. Most migrate seasonally to Gujarat's sugar mills, working 14-18 hour days.

### Infrastructure Failures

The Employment Guarantee Scheme exists only on paper. Schools rarely function. Health expenditure declined from 1% to 0.6% of state GDP between the 1980s and late 1990s.

## Statistics

- 65% of tribal children in Maharashtra are undernourished
- 83% of tribal children are anemic
- 48.5% of women are anemic
- 72% of families are landless or own fewer than three acres

## Systemic Issues

Health workers attribute poor outcomes to "tribal lifestyle," yet language barriers and prejudice obscure systemic failures. Land title disputes prevent tribals from cultivating degraded forest areas despite a 1995 Supreme Court judgment supporting their claims.

## Conclusion

The article concludes that until rights are enforced, cycles of exploitation and preventable child deaths will persist in these remote communities.
