This investigative piece examines the agricultural crisis devastating farmers in Nashik district, one of Maharashtra's more developed regions. Despite being called "India's California," the area has seen record suicides among cultivators facing insurmountable debt.

## The Fatal Toll

Pandurang Kadam, a 60-year-old onion farmer, immolated himself in the Lasalgaon market yard on April 20, 2006. In his pocket, authorities found his receipt and final message detailing debts totaling tens of thousands of rupees and stating, "The market price was too low for him to recover any of the costs."

## The Central Problem

Increased production has paradoxically impoverished farmers. Onion output across India rose from 40 lakh tonnes five years prior to 60 lakh tonnes, yet prices crashed to ₹200-250 per quintal—far below the ₹350-400 production cost. This pattern repeated when farmers shifted to grape cultivation, hoping for better returns.

## Individual Cases

**Punjaram Thakre** invested ₹1.5 lakh in grape farming after years of onion losses. Despite annual expenditures of ₹50,000-70,000, he recovered only ₹40,000. His accumulated bank debt reached ₹2.5 lakh. His wife, Shantibai, jumped into a well on July 1st, unable to cope with repayment pressure.

**Sakari Dargude's** son, Vijay (19), consumed pesticide on April 2, 2006, after his father sold cattle to repay a ₹1.35 lakh loan installment. Vijay opposed the sale.

## Structural Issues

- Surplus production drives prices below cultivation costs
- Middlemen capture profits while farmers absorb losses
- Government provides minimum support prices for wheat and oilseeds but not perishables
- Pesticide costs have doubled; grape farmers must spray six times using 12+ different formulations

## Expert Perspectives

C.B. Holkar (National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation) emphasizes: "Farmers can't even recover their costs." He advocates for minimum support price guarantees on perishables.

Balasaheb Kshirsagar (Maharashtra Grape Producers Association) notes grape cultivation costs now reach ₹80-90,000 per acre (₹1+ lakh for export crops), while prices halved from ₹10-20 to ₹6-10 per kilogram.

## Systemic Critique

Farmers question why governments import wheat at ₹1,400 per quintal while capping domestic prices at ₹800-900. They argue that modest price increases for urban consumers would prevent agricultural collapse and farmer deaths.
