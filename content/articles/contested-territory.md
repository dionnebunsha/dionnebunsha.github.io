## The Government Crackdown

Following Narendra Modi's assumption of India's prime ministership in May 2014, his administration moved to eliminate obstacles to corporate projects. An Intelligence Bureau report accused foreign-funded NGOs of "threatening the country's economic security" by opposing mining, nuclear, and industrial projects.

One immediate target was Greenpeace India. The home ministry attempted blocking its foreign funding, which the organization successfully challenged in Delhi High Court.

## Competing Perspectives

Anti-nuclear activist SP Udayakumar counters that development definitions matter: "When the Prime Minister travels the world to invite foreign capital and sell the country to corporations, it is called diplomacy."

The article notes a paradox: while the government targets NGOs for foreign funding, it ignores millions flowing to rightwing RSS affiliates from American donors.

## The Left's Critique

Traditional leftist intellectuals argue NGOs deflect revolution and create dependency. Author Arundhati Roy asserts they function as buffers between governments and citizens, ultimately serving funders rather than communities.

However, numerous grassroots movements operate independently without NGO support, while appreciating their assistance. Local activist Lingaraj Azad emphasizes movement self-reliance, questioning whether NGO funding genuinely produces social change.

## Positive Contributions

Despite criticisms, NGOs have influenced policy positively—including campaigns for the Right to Information Act 2005 and renewable energy initiatives. The article acknowledges many organizations work effectively with marginalized populations on overlooked issues.

## The Underlying Issue

The crux remains land acquisition. Governments facilitate corporate takeovers of agricultural and forest lands, a global phenomenon affecting millions of hectares. This commodification of territory underpins the conflict between development and resistance movements.
