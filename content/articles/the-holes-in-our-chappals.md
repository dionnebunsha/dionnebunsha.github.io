Gujarat's farmers face a silent crisis that the government refuses to acknowledge. While Modi boasts that "Gujarat's farmers drive Maruti cars," widows of deceased farmers tell a different story. Ramesh Pungalpara hanged himself after two consecutive crop failures, yet police altered records to attribute his death to family disputes rather than agricultural distress.

## The Real Numbers

The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, the BJP's own farmer wing, estimates around 300 farmer suicides annually—double the government's official count of 148. Police deliberately avoid registering cases as agriculturally motivated, instead attributing deaths to "illness" or "domestic disputes."

## Case Studies of Desperation

Pahubhai Dakhada (35) died under debt, leaving his widow Vajuben in social isolation. The Kakane family—four members—drowned themselves after accumulating Rs 1.5 lakh in debt at 60% interest rates.

## Root Causes

Rising input costs for seeds, pesticides, water, and power have made farming economically unviable. Cotton farmers earn approximately Rs 13-16,000 per acre while spending Rs 7,000-16,000. Processing companies capture profits while producers struggle.

Genetically-modified Bt seeds (both legal and illegal varieties) dominate, though cheaper bootleg versions slightly ease costs. Yet overall expenses continue climbing faster than harvest prices.

## Structural Problems

Small farmers cannot compete in commercialized agriculture. Moneylenders control rural economies with police support. Social customs compound hardship—widows face strict confinement, unable to work or access community support.

## Government Response

Agriculture Minister Bhupendra Singh Chudasama denies farmer suicides exist, contradicting his own department's statistics. He dismisses deaths as family matters beyond government responsibility.

## Symbolic Resistance

Farmers in Malak Nes village displayed their worn chappals (sandals) with gaping holes, asking the journalist to show Modi that Gujarat's farmers cannot afford even basic footwear, let alone luxury vehicles.
