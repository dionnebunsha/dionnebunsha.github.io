## The Legal Action

Zakia Jafri, widow of slain Member of Parliament Ahsan Jafri, filed a complaint against Chief Minister Narendra Modi and 62 others for their alleged involvement in the 2002 Gujarat communal violence. The complaint named VHP leaders, government ministers, MLAs, and police officials.

## The Context

Over four years after the 2002 pogrom that killed more than 1,000 people and displaced 150,000, Jafri took legal action. Her husband was murdered during the attack on Gulbarg Society in Ahmedabad, where approximately 50 others died and women were assaulted.

## The Charges

The FIR accused the defendants of "aiding and abetting the mass carnage" and claimed "a mass carnage was orchestrated by the most powerful in the State executive."

## Key Testimony

Additional Director-General of Police R.B. Sreekumar provided damning testimony, alleging Modi instructed police to "let the mobs vent their anger." Sreekumar documented illegal police instructions and stated that officers preventing violence faced punishment while those permitting it received rewards.

## Why Direct Legal Action

Jafri's son, Tanvir, explained the family pursued direct legal action because judicial commissions had become ineffective. He questioned why police failed to protect his father despite ten hours' advance warning.

## Broader Context

The article noted similar judicial commissions investigating 1984 anti-Sikh riots and 1992-93 Mumbai riots had produced minimal prosecutions decades later.
