This investigative piece examines the agricultural crisis in Vidarbha, Maharashtra's cotton belt, following a violent incident in Wani where police fired on farmers during cotton procurement protests.

## The Crisis

The article documents the frustrations of cotton farmers facing severe delays in government procurement centers. With harvest ready for sale but processing severely backlogged, farmers endured multi-day waits. The situation escalated in Wani on December 8, 2006, when approximately 1,500 farmers clashed with a Cotton Confederation of India grader who rejected cotton as too moist. The confrontation resulted in a ransacked agricultural office and police gunfire that killed farmer Dinesh Gogul, leaving his widow Savita and young son without a breadwinner.

## Key Issues Explored

### Procurement Delays

The state began cotton purchasing two months late, creating bottlenecks at the few operational centers.

### Price Collapse

Government procurement rates fell from Rs 2,700 per quintal in 2001 to under Rs 2,000 by 2006, while production costs continued rising.

### Systemic Crisis

The broader agricultural emergency claimed approximately 1,200 suicides since June 2005, with three to five occurring daily across Vidarbha's six districts.

### Policy Failure

The 1972 Monopoly Cotton Procurement Scheme, designed to protect farmers from trader exploitation, deteriorated after 1995 when world cotton prices dropped.

## Notable Quote

One farmer expressed the underlying tension: "What happened in Wani can happen again anywhere if the state doesn't give us a fair price for our cotton."
