## Overview

The article documents a mass marriage ceremony at a school courtyard in Amaravati, where 12 couples from different communities participated. The government provides each couple with a mangalsutra, gas cylinder, and vessels worth approximately 10,000 rupees as part of its rehabilitation package. Over 6,740 couples have participated in such mass weddings across the Vidarbha region.

## The Crisis Context

Vidarbha, once a prosperous cotton-producing region, faces severe agricultural collapse. Since June 2005, there have been 592 farmer suicides. Contributing factors include:

- "Spiralling costs of inputs and falling output prices have meant huge losses"
- Heavy pesticide and fertilizer use increasing expenses without proportional yield increases
- Bank credit insufficient to meet rising costs, forcing farmers to borrow from moneylenders at rates between 60-120 percent
- Lack of government trade tariffs protecting cotton farmers
- Insufficient agricultural extension services

## Individual Stories

**Kishan Bansod and Asmita Wankhede** — The featured couple. Bansod noted that Asmita's family could not afford a traditional wedding without government assistance.

**Namdeo Wankhede** — A struggling farmer with three acres of land, unable to fund crop inputs or his daughter's wedding. He explained: "If people with more than 10 acres can't make both ends meet, how are we supposed to survive?"

**Dayaram Athavale** — A daily-wage laborer earning only 40 rupees daily for 2-3 days weekly. His daughter Kavita married via the mass wedding program, allowing her to relocate to Nagpur where her husband works as a security guard.

## Ceremony Details

The wedding ceremony was secular and non-hierarchical, featuring:
- No priest, fire, or elaborate rituals
- Recitation of a sloka (Sanskrit verse)
- Exchange of garlands and mangalsutra
- Photos and paintings of the Buddha, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Jyotiba Phule, Shahu Maharaj, and Shivaji

## Impact Assessment

For participating families, these mass weddings provide economic relief and emotional solace. As one bride's sister noted, the approach costs significantly less than traditional ceremonies while maintaining dignity and community participation. The program addresses a critical symptom of the farm crisis while broader structural problems persist unresolved.
