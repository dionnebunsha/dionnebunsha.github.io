## The Approach

This piece explores organic farming as a cost-reduction solution to India's farm crisis. The author argues that while farmers cannot control government policies on prices and subsidies, they can reduce cultivation costs through indigenous organic practices.

## Sristi's Work

The article centers on work by Sristi, an organization developing eco-friendly agricultural solutions. Rather than relying on expensive pesticides and fertilizers, farmers can create organic alternatives from locally available plants.

**Key argument:** "Farmers can get the same or a better yield without spending on pesticide and fertilizer."

## The Core Problem

The core problem identified is that cultivation costs exceed the pittance farmers receive for crops. Over a decade, living costs rose while cotton prices fell, collapsing rural economies.

## Professor Anil Gupta's Solution

Identify plants animals won't eat—these naturally contain toxins useful as pesticides. Buttermilk whey serves as growth promoter. Lantana weed can control bollworms while eliminating an invasive species.

## Case Study

Pramod Kadam reduced costs from Rs. 5,000-8,000 per acre to Rs. 3,000 while increasing yield from 2.5 to 4 quintals per acre by switching to organic cotton.

## Broader Context

The author contends that while organic farming isn't the complete solution, it remains the only remedy within farmers' direct control, given government neglect of agricultural extension services and preference for corporate seed companies.
