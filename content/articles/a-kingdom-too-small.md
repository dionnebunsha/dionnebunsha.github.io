## Lions Seeking New Territories

Small groups of the world's last surviving Asiatic lions have migrated from the Gir Sanctuary toward Diu's coastal forests, approximately 80 kilometers away. The 1,421 square kilometer protected area cannot sustain only 327 remaining Asiatic lions globally.

"It may seem unusual to find a lion on the coast, but this isn't the first time" they have appeared in coastal regions, notes Bharat Pathak, Conservator of Forest (Wildlife). Lions once roamed 2,560 square kilometers but now occupy less than half that territory. Three to four distinct populations now exist outside the sanctuary: 13 lions inhabit Girnar hills, 20 roam coastal areas, 16 occupy the Hipavadli-Savarkundla region, and 7 occupy other locations.

## The Relocation Debate

Dr. Ravi Chellam's Wildlife Institute of India survey recommends relocating lions to Kuno forest in northern Madhya Pradesh, over 1,000 kilometers distant. The report emphasizes: "If restricted to a single site which is relatively small in size, the lions face many extinction threats – genetic and environmental."

The Gujarat government opposes relocation, preferring lions remain uniquely Gujarati. Pradeep Khanna, Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), argues: "When natural dispersal of lions is taking place around Gir, why interfere with nature?"

P.P. Rawal, chief forest conservator at Gir, counters that in-breeding causes 70% of cubs' deaths, and only 92 males and 100 females remain reproductively viable. He contends: "You need at least 250 pairs for the survival of any species."

Wildlife experts disagree with the state's position. Dr. Chellam argues the government has successfully increased lion numbers but must "manage that success and think long term."

## The Unique Asiatic Lion

The Asiatic lion differs genetically and physically from African lions, featuring a looser belly fold and less dense mane. Historically, they inhabited Asia Minor, Arabia, Persia, and the Indian subcontinent as far as Bihar and Orissa, with the Narmada river marking the southern boundary. By the 1880s, Gir harbored the only remaining wild population.

The Nawab of Junagadh, a former hunter, declared a hunting ban after discovering only 12 lions remained in the early 1900s. The 1936 census recorded 287 lions; by 1968, numbers dropped to 177 due to habitat loss. Following the 1965 sanctuary declaration, populations steadily increased.

## Sanctuary Pressures

The sanctuary faces significant pressures. Five highways, a railroad, and 2.5 lakh annual tourists traverse the forest. Three major temples (among 23 religious shrines) attract more visitors than wildlife safaris. Limestone mining and nearby cement factories degrade habitat and deplete water resources, forcing lions to seek water and prey beyond sanctuary boundaries. Lions have recently fallen into village wells.

## The Maldhari Question

The government targets the Maldharis—local herdsmen living within the forest—for relocation. Though lions prey on their cattle, Maldharis practice non-aggressive defense, accepting predation as natural. The 1972 relocation effort moved 580 of 845 families, but many struggled as farmers and sold their land. Today, 54 Nesses (400 families) remain inside the sanctuary.

Maldhari Jaggo Ruda Jatwa explains their resistance: "The land they gave as compensation was stony, you can't farm on that land. We have 25 cattle, so we stay here."

Pathak maintains relocation improves quality of life and preserves habitat. However, Dr. Chellam disagrees: "For the survival of the lions, the Maldharis are not an issue. Lions can co-exist with humans."

Forest trackers emphasize Maldhari importance, arguing: "The Maldharis and their livestock are essential to the forest ecosystem." Dr. Chellam counters that wild prey populations increased dramatically after relocation and protected area designation, shifting lion diets from livestock to chital deer.

## The Path Forward

The debate continues as lions reclaim lost territories, moving beyond sanctuary boundaries—even reaching beaches. Some experts suggest this natural dispersal alone cannot ensure species survival, requiring managed translocation to new habitats.
