## The Committee Finding

The article examines the Justice Banerjee Committee's findings on the Godhra train fire of February 27, 2002, which concluded the incident was accidental rather than a terrorist conspiracy. This contradicts the police investigation that blamed Muslims for deliberately setting the fire, leading to communal violence across Gujarat.

## The Impact

On 27th February 2002, Ishaq Mohammed Mamdu (30) was at his home in Godhra when he heard about the fire that burned a compartment of the Sabarmati Express when it stopped at Godhra station early that morning. Ishaq is blind and stayed indoors when curfew orders were passed. Normally, he helped his brother Shabbir in his scrap business. Two months later, the police arrested him under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) for allegedly being part of a conspiracy to burn the train. Ishaq's bail applications have been rejected. The tension of his confinement killed his mother, and he remains in jail.

Not only Ishaq, but the entire Muslim community was blamed for the Godhra tragedy. The Sangh Parivar used it to launch violence against Muslims in Gujarat, during which more than 1,000 people were killed and 150,000 were made homeless.

## The Committee's Work

Almost three years after the fire, the Justice Banerjee high level committee found no proof of the 'terrorist conspiracy' alleged against the 104 accused. The train caught fire accidentally—the first government response contradicting police findings.

However, the Banerjee committee has no legal powers. It merely submitted findings to the railway ministry. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Gujarat police still maintains its conspiracy theory, with the matter being heard in POTA court.

## The Police Theory

The SIT claims "a core group of around 15 to 20 people were involved in the conspiracy," masterminded at Aman Guest House. According to investigators, six people allegedly entered compartment S6, poured 120 litres of petrol, and threw burning rags through windows. Key evidence included a court confession by Zabir Bin Yameen Behra, though he later recanted, claiming police coercion.

## The Committee's Rejection

The Banerjee committee rejected this theory. It noted that "the inflammable liquid theory gets negated by the statement of some of the passengers who suffered injuries on the upper portion of the body" and emerged without serious injury. The report found it implausible that armed Kar Sevaks would allow themselves to be burned by such an attack.

The committee also dismissed the 'miscreant theory'—that hawkers threw stones and burning rags at Kar Sevaks inside S6. "The committee has noted the forensic laboratory's experiment and verified its conclusion that it was impossible to set fire to the train from outside."

Eliminating the petrol theory, miscreant theory, and electrical fire possibility, the committee concluded the case was an "accidental fire"—without explaining how. Notably, the report ignores the brawl that occurred at the station platform and continued when the train stopped moments later, with a mob hurling stones and burning rags.

## Administrative Failures

The committee criticized railway administration for pre-judging the cause as 'miscreant activity' without inquiry. No statutory investigation was conducted. Neither the railway minister nor Board members visited the accident site or injured passengers. Crucially, evidence was not preserved; the S7 coach traveled onward to Ahmedabad despite damage.

## The Deeper Question

Railway minister Lalu Yadav uses the committee findings as political strategy against the BJP and Sangh Parivar, who had immediately labeled Godhra as terrorism and used it to build Hindu nationalist fervor and carry out revenge killings. Yet a deeper question emerges: even if a terrorist conspiracy existed, does it justify the state-sponsored violence that followed?
