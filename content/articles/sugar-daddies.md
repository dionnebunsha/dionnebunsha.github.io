## The Farmer's Plight

Balasaheb Shinde, a sugarcane farmer in Beed, Maharashtra, faces such severe debt that he must migrate for work as a cane cutter, leaving his older children behind unattended. Despite owning farmland, sugarcane farming has become unprofitable for him.

## Political Control and Corruption

Gopinath Munde, opposition leader in Maharashtra, exemplifies how politicians dominate the sugar industry. His party controls the Ambejogai cooperative where Balasaheb holds membership. Munde and his wife personally own multiple sugar factories, demonstrating the pervasive pattern where politicians operate co-operatives as personal fiefdoms rather than democratic institutions serving members.

The article explains that sugarcane was introduced to western Maharashtra during the 1950s as an easily profitable crop. Politicians invested government funds extensively, developing infrastructure and securing irrigation subsidies. This created regional advantages that persisted, with political networks linking village representatives through state leadership to sugar co-operatives.

## Financial Deterioration

Fifty-six of Maharashtra's 163 sugar mills face bankruptcy due to corruption and nepotism. The state government contributed thirty-percent equity stakes and guaranteed sixty-percent loan-based equity, yet few repayments materialized. Nineteen factories obtained loans ostensibly for production but ceased operations without farmer or creditor repayment.

Farmers receive minimal revenue shares. While sugar commands Rs12 ($0.26) domestically and Rs10 ($0.21) internationally per kilogram, farmers earn only Rs6.25 ($0.14) or less.

## Farmer Exploitation

Sugarcane prices declined approximately twenty-five percent over five years. One-third of factories failed paying the government-mandated minimum price of Rs695 ($15.1) per tonne. Production costs increased roughly sixty-seven percent within five years due to power, irrigation, and liberalization-related charges.

Small farmers accumulate Rs10,000-15,000 ($217-326) additional annual debt. At eighteen-month crop cycles, net farmer income approximates Rs5,000 ($109) per acre—merely Rs278 ($6) monthly.

Moneylenders charge interest rates between thirty-five and sixty percent. Many farmers sold land portions to moneylenders who regained dominance after government and cooperative bank influence weakened.

## Agricultural Priorities

Although sugarcane comprises only four percent of Maharashtra's total cropped area, it consumes sixty percent of irrigated water. This disparity reflects political prioritization favoring sugar regions while neglecting other agricultural areas.

Some farmers switched to soya beans, but soya prices crashed fifty percent within one year. Cash crops remain necessary for medical bills and school fees, plus they facilitate bank loans. This season's pest infestation destroyed half the crop, further destabilizing incomes.

## Migrant Worker Conditions

Workers from neglected central Maharashtra regions migrate during the six-month harvesting season. Contractors hired by factories bring them in groups and provide advances, creating debt cycles. Contractors charge sixty-percent annual interest on unpaid balances.

Workers like Shivaji labored extensively yet struggled offsetting advance amounts. Many returned to villages with outstanding repayment obligations. Workers earned Rs100-115 ($2.5) per tonne for bullock-cart owners and Rs65 ($1.41) for tractor workers, though actual compensation often decreased due to loan deductions.

Uttam Siserao worked an entire 2001-02 season unpaid, repaying his deceased wife's medical advance. Most workers exhausted advances in villages purchasing daily rations by selling sugarcane leaves as fodder, returning home empty-handed.

## Systemic Irony

Warehouses overflow with sugar despite farmer and worker deprivation. The government offers export subsidies encouraging sales, yet farmers and workers receive no profit share.

Farmer Shetgonda Patil summarizes the contradiction: "We have shares in the factory. We grow the cane. But we don't get to taste any sugar – not even a pinch."
