## The Desperate Protests

Desperate to highlight their plight, villages including Shingnapur, Dorli, Lehegaon, and Shivni Rasulapur have launched dramatic protests. Farmers erected a "Kidney Sale Centre" banner and invited national leaders to inaugurate it, reflecting their willingness to sell body organs rather than starve.

## The Crisis

Since June 2005, approximately 309 farmers in Vidarbh have committed suicide. The region's once-prosperous cotton belt has deteriorated due to liberalization policies. Production costs have tripled or quintupled while cotton prices plummeted from Rs 2,500 per quintal in 1991 to Rs 1,785 by publication date.

## Economic Factors

- Traders charge 60-120% interest on loans
- Government procurement dropped 96% year-over-year
- Import duties on cotton remain at just 10%, while sugar has 60% protection
- International cotton prices fell from $1.10 to 52 cents per pound

## Human Impact

The article profiles affected farmers, including Jagdish Deshmukh, who died by pesticide in December 2005, leaving his widow managing three children and substantial debt. Children abandoned schooling; families sold cattle and cut orange orchards. Landless laborers migrated cityward, returning after failing to secure sustainable work.

## Systemic Problems

Government withdrawal of market controls, tariffs, and subsidies left Indian farmers competing against heavily subsidized American and European producers without domestic protections or adequate infrastructure like irrigation systems.
