## The Unwanted Notoriety

Ansari's face, captured during the riots, transformed him into an unintentional symbol of communal violence. However, this recognition has made ordinary life impossible. He explained his situation at a Mumbai press conference: "The media has put such a big responsibility on me by making me the face of Gujarat. I can't go anywhere in Ahmedabad."

## Economic Impact

As a tailor, Ansari's earnings halved following the riots. Public recognition prevents him from working openly in markets. He attempted to find work in Malegaon, Maharashtra, but was forced to leave after a local newspaper published his photograph, with his employer fearing police or media inquiries.

## Emotional Toll

Ansari expressed deep frustration: "Why can't I roam freely?" His family members experience secondary trauma. He recounted how his seven-year-old daughter was asked why her father "always cries," a comment that deeply wounded him.

## Path Forward

The West Bengal government, learning of his situation through Communalism Combat magazine, offered Ansari assistance to relocate to Kolkata. The government agreed to fund his rent for one year and establish a tailoring workshop with sewing machines.

Despite this opportunity, Ansari remains connected to his roots, hoping eventually to return to Ahmedabad and celebrate Eid with his Hindu neighbors.
